# Bluetooth Helper

Bluetooth Helper, also known as BtHelper, is a module that enhances the<br>
functionality of Bluetooth devices, specifically Apple AirPods series, by providing<br>
features such as battery level display and device icons.<br>
These features are not currently supported by the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).<br>

BtHelper is developed using code from two primary sources:<br>
[OpenPods](https://github.com/adolfintel/OpenPods), [capod](https://github.com/d4rken-org/capod) and [xingrz](https://github.com/xingrz)'s system setting implementation.<br>
The collaboration of these projects has enabled the creation of BtHelper with its extended capabilities.<br>
